/**
 * The watchdog that stops this runtime outliving its host.
 *
 * Nothing else in the process notices a dead host: `awaitTermination` blocks on this process's
 * own gRPC server, and the kernel channel redials a dead peer indefinitely. Without the
 * watchdog every host launch leaves a full cohort of plugin JVMs running forever.
 *
 * These tests deliberately watch processes this JVM did **not** spawn. In production the watched
 * process is the parent, which is never a child of the watcher, and `ProcessHandle.onExit()`
 * takes a different path for non-children (it cannot reap them, so it polls). A test that
 * watched a spawned child would exercise the wrong half of the JDK and pass regardless.
