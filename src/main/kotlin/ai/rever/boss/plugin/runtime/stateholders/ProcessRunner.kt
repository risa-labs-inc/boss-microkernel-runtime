/**
 * The one place the CLI-backed state holders spawn a child process.
 *
 * Three rules hold for every caller, lifted from the plugins these holders
 * mirror (`DockerCli`, `KubectlCli`, `HelmCli`, `ClaudeCodeCliBackend`) because
 * each had independently arrived at them:
 *
 * 1. **Absolute binary plus a widened child PATH.** `ProcessBuilder` resolves a
 *    bare command name against the *parent* process's PATH. A plugin child JVM
 *    inherits that from the host, which on macOS is nearly empty when the app
 *    was launched from Finder — so a bare `"docker"` works in dev and fails in
 *    the shipped app.
 * 2. **argv lists, never a shell string.** Container names, resource names and
 *    paths come from daemon output and from user input; passing a
 *    `List<String>` means there is no shell to inject into.
 * 3. **Cancellation kills the child.** A cancelled coroutine must not leave a
 *    live CLI process behind, and closing the child's streams is what unblocks
 *    the reads — so the kill is wired to job completion rather than left to the
 *    blocking read returning.
 *
 * Resolution deliberately searches `PATH` **before** [ExecResult]-shaped
 * fallback install dirs, which is what lets a test put a stub binary first on a
 * spawned child's PATH and be certain the real one is never reached.
